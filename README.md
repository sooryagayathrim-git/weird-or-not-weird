# weird-or-not-weird
This project checks whether a given integer is "Weird" or "Not Weird" according to a set of rules. 
If the number is odd, it prints "Weird". If the number is even and in the range 2–5, it prints "Not Weird". 
If the number is even and in the range 6–20, it prints "Weird". If the number is even and greater than 20, it prints "Not Weird". 
The program uses simple conditional statements to evaluate the number and display the result.
